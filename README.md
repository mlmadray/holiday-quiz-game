# holiday-quiz-game

A cute little Holiday Quiz Game App I created using html, css, and Javascript because I was upset that my other Javascript assignements were confusing. The best way to learn (for me, at least) is by doing! So here it is. Big thanks to the internet for helping me when I was stuck. 

Functionality I'd like to add eventually: 
- the ability to use any array of ten questions
- the ability to see your score at the end of the game
